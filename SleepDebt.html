        Just like any other debt, Sleep debt is a form of debt you have to pay to your body in the form of sleep. The less you sleep, the more the sleep debt builds up. This is the reason you feel tired in the morning even after sleeping 8 hours the night before.

        <h4 align = "center">Reasons To Reduce Sleep Debt!</h4>
      </div>
      <p class="description">
        High amounts of sleep debt increases the risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart attack, stroke, and depression. Almost 20% of all serious car crashes are associated with driver sleepiness.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Sleep loss impairs brain function, concentration, coordination, and increases the risk of error. With just 24 hours of no sleep: you attentional failures double, and your reaction time is comparable to being legally drunk. Deduction and Critical-Thinking isin't affected much by the loss of sleep, but Decision-making is highly affected.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Sleep loss also results in increased hunger and appetite and impaired glucose tolerance. This results in increased weight gain and can lead to obesity. This also creates a loop, as studies link higher BMI's (Body Mass Index) to worse sleep, only leading to worse sleep and more weight gain.
      </p>
      <p class = "description">
        It is NOT normal to feel drowsy during daytime. Your brain keeps an accurate count of your sleep debt. If you feel drowsy during the day, no matter how big of a lunch you had or how boring the meeting is, then you must have a considerate amount of sleep debt.

      <p class="description">
        In a study conducted by Thomas Wehr in 1992 where he first got rid of the sleep debt of all his subjects, he found that the subjects settled into an average of 8.25 hours of sleep a night. Interestingly, their sleep also became biphasic!
