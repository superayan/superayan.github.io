    <p class="description">
      The reason that coffee makes us feel awake and alert is because of caffeine that is present in it.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Caffeine is primarily found in coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa beans, chocolate and the kola nut. 90% of Americans consume caffeine in one form or the other.
      400 mg of caffeine per day is considered as the upper limit of a daily dose by the FSA and the AMA. 20-30% of Americans consume more than 600 mg a day!
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      A home-brewed cup of coffee has about 80 mg of caffeine. A 350 ml (12 oz) cup of Starbucks has about 260 mg. Chocolate bar can have 5 - 60 mg. Sodas contain around 35-55 mg caffeine per 350 ml. Energy drinks such as Red Bull and Rockstar have upwards of 80 mg/ can.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Caffeine primarily acts on <u>Adenosine</u> a neurotransmitter in the Central Nervous System.
      Adenosine builds up as a breakdown product of ATP (ATP is created by Mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell) As we consume more energy throughout the day, the amount of Adenosine builds up. It then binds to adenosine receptors that slow down nerve cell activity and induce drowsiness.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      To a nerve cell, caffeine looks just like adenosine! Coffee competitively binds to the adenosine receptor, preventing the adenosine from binding. But unlike adenosine, caffeine does not slow down nerve cell activity and induce drowsiness, resulting in us not feeling tired and sleepy!
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Adenosine causes nerve cells to relax, but caffeine causes the brain's blood vessels to constrict. This is why some headache medicines contain caffeine (like excedrin or Anacin).
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The reason why drinking coffee also makes us feel alert is because it indirectly increases neuron firing. The hypothalamus (a part of the brain) senses that the adenosine is getting blocked and that there is some sort of emergency happening. This results in the firing of adrenaline and cortisol (a stress hormone), invoking a minor "flight or flight" response.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The most rejuvenating phase of sleep is deep sleep (about 20 % of total sleep in one night). Adenosine is important in establishing deep sleep. As a result, caffeine leads to a decrease in deep sleep, causing your sleep not being as rejuvenating.

      <h4 align = "center">Why is Cofee So Addicting?</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">
      Dopamine(DA) is a neurotransmitter that activates pleasure centers in the brain. Caffeine increases the amount of DA in our body(as do drugs of abuse like heroin and cocaine!). This extra DA in our body makes us feel good and makes us wanting to come back for more.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Also when the caffeine induced adrenalin wears off, you feel fatigued and are in a low mood. This makes you wanting to get the adrenaline flowing again by drinking another cup of coffee!

    <ul class="ulPositioner">
      <li>Caffeine is fully absorbed within 45 mins.</li>
      <li>It does not suppress appetite.</li>
      <li>Caffeine, contrary to popular belief, does not reduce the effects of alcohol, and only provides temporary relief from fatigue and drowsiness.</li>
      <li>The <u>half life</u> of caffeine is about 6 hours ( it takes 6 hours for the caffeine in your body to be reduced by half.</li>
      <li>Leads to an increase in urine production.</li>
      <li>Consumption is linked to improved glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.</li>
      <li>Consumption before driving greatly decreases the likelihood of crashing.</li>
      <li>High doses of caffeine is toxic and more than 12 highly caffeinated drinks within a few hours can potentially be lethal.</li>
    </ul>
