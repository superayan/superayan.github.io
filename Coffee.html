    <p class="description">
      The reason that coffee makes us feel awake and alert is because of caffeine that is present in it.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Caffeine is primarily found in coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa beans, chocolate and the kola nut. 90% of Americans consume caffeine in one form or the other.
      400 mg of caffeine per day is considered as the upper limit of a daily dose, but some Americans consume more than 600 mg a day!
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      A home-brewed cup of coffee has about 80 mg of caffeine. A 350 ml (12 oz) cup of Starbucks has about 260 mg. Chocolate bar can have 5 - 60 mg. Sodas contain around 35-55 mg caffeine per 350 ml. Energy drinks such as Red Bull and Rockstar have upwards of 80 mg/ can.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Caffeine primarily acts on the neurotransmitter <u>Adenosine</u>. Adenosine builds up throughout the day and binds to adenosine receptors that induce drowsiness and make us feel sleeppy.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      To a nerve cell, caffeine looks just like adenosine! Instead of adenosine, cofee starts binding to the receptors. This prevents the adenosine from making us tired and sleepy.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Adenosine causes nerve cells to relax, but caffeine causes the brain's blood vessels to constrict. This is why some headache medicines contain caffeine (like Excedrin or Anacin).
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Caffeine also increases neuron firing, making us feel alert. Our brain senses that the adenosine is getting blocked and that there is some sort of emergency happening. This results in the firing of adrenaline and cortisol (a stress hormone), invoking a minor "flight or flight" response.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Adenosine establishes deep sleep, the most rejuvenating phase of sleep. As a result, caffeine leads to a decrease in deep sleep, causing your sleep not being as rejuvenating.

      <h4 align = "center">Why is Cofee So Addicting?</h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">
      Dopamine(DA) is a neurotransmitter that activates pleasure centers in the brain. Caffeine increases the amount of DA in our body(as do drugs of abuse like heroin and cocaine!). This extra DA in our body makes us feel good and makes us wanting to come back for more.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Also when the caffeine induced adrenalin wears off, you feel fatigued and are in a low mood. This makes you wanting to get the adrenaline flowing again by drinking another cup of coffee!

    <ul class="ulPositioner">
      <li>Caffeine is fully absorbed within 45 mins.</li>
      <li>It does not suppress appetite.</li>
      <li>Caffeine, contrary to popular belief, does not reduce the effects of alcohol, and only provides temporary relief from fatigue and drowsiness.</li>
      <li>The <u>half life</u> of caffeine is about 6 hours ( it takes 6 hours for the caffeine in your body to be reduced by half.</li>
      <li>Leads to an increase in urine production.</li>
      <li>Consumption is linked to improved glucose metabolism and insulin secretion.</li>
      <li>Consumption before driving greatly decreases the likelihood of crashing.</li>
      <li>High doses of caffeine is toxic and more than 12 highly caffeinated drinks within a few hours can potentially be lethal.</li>
    </ul>
