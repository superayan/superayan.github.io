    <div class = "divGap">
      <p class = "description">
        A self sustained biological rhythm that normally synchronizes to roughly 24 hours. Circa = approximately and dia = day. Your natural Circadian Rhythm is still followed by your body even if you haven't slept for a few days.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Your Circadian Rhythm dictates when you feel sleepy and when you feel active. It does so by releasing a certain combination of different neurochemicals and hormones according to the time of the day. Your natural rhythm is primarily influenced by your exposure to light, but certain external substances can also have an influence on it, eg- stress, anxiety, caffeine, work load, exercise.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
      It determines many of your neurobehavioral functions such as physical alertness and cognitive performance, and can also be the reason why you feel fine the morning after pulling an all-nighter. Another core feature of the Circadian Rhythm is that it regulates your body temperature.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        These four natural body functions are unaffected* by whether or not you have slept, and are entirely driven by the time of the day:
        <ul class="ulPositioner">
          <li>Cognitive Performance</li>
          <li>Visual Reaction Time</li>
          <li>Core Body Temperature</li>
          <li>Subjective Sleepiness Rating</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class = "description">
        *your cognitive performance might decrease with less sleep, but point of highest and lowest cognitive performance throughout the day is determined by your circadian rhythm.

        <li>Regulates physiology and behavior by ensuring the necessary neurochemicals fire at the correct time.</li>

        The clock: known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus and is located at the optic chasm: where the optic nerves cross with the hypothalamus.
      </p>
      <p class ="description">
        The hormone with the greatest impact on the circadian rhythm is Melatonin. It is secreted by the pineal gland and primarily during darkness. It invokes drowsiness and lowers the core body temperature. Sufficient enough light to the retina can slow the secretion of melatonin. (eg- blue light form your phone/computer before sleep). As you get older you produce less melatonin and this explains the delayed sleep in older people.
