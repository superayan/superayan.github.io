      This works by helping us keep our Circadian Rhythm in proper synchronization. The correct Hormones and neurochemicals fire at the correct time and make us feel sleepy when we need to. It can make falling alseep or waking up significantly easier!

      <h4 align = "center"><u>Exercise Daily But Not At Night</u></h4>
    </div>
    <p class="description">
      Our Core Body Temperature naturally starts to cool down towards the night. This helps us fall asleep. If we exercise in the evening or night, our CBT rises and can lead to difficulty in falling asleep.

      <h4 align = "center"><u>Invent a Relaxing Bedtime Routine</u></h4>
    </div>
    <p class = "description">
      This has been proven to be very successful. 30 - 20 mins before sleep create a routine that only involves relaxing activities - reading a book, opening mail, etc. Washing your feet works very well! Try to avoid watching netflix or browsing social media. A small snack before bed has also been shown to promote sleep.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Mantaing a routine will psychologically prepare your body for sleep, making it easier for you to fall asleep.
      If you experience anxiety while in bed, get a worry-diary. At least 30 mins before going to bed, write down everything that is worrying you and that you need to complete, along with the time you will complete it the next day or in the coming days.

    <div class= "subHeader">
      <h4 align = "center"><u>Avoid Caffeine, Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Drugs!</u></h4>
    </div>
    <p class = "description">
      Caffeine inhibits one of the primary neurochemicals that makes us feel sleepy. Avoid consuming it within 6 hours of bedtime. Although, low doses of alcohol(1 drink or less) are generally sleep promoting.
      Cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs have been proven to reduce the quality of sleep and cause fragmented sleep.
      <div class= "subHeader">
        <h4 align = "center"><u>Use The Bed Only For Sleep</u></h4>
      </div>
      <p class = "description">
        This is a technique called conditioning. If you only sleep in your bed, your mind automatically associates the bed with sleep.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Watching Tv or studying in your bed do the opposite! So when you finally lie down to sleep, your mind starts thinking about the show you are currently following or the homework you have due. This can invoke anxiety and make it harder to fall asleep.
